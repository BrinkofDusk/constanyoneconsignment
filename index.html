            <li id="pe"> Product Education
                <p>We realize that not every product is straightforward in how it's meant to be used. We take the time to research the products we sell, so that way we can educate the consumer in it's use if anything is unclear. In addition to this, we also provide the manuals for the products if applicable, as well as any instruction on how to fix common issues. Why spend money hiring someone for a fix that you can do yourself?</p>
